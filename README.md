# SPM_Kurs
Scripts for my group of the 2021 SPM course at ISN Hamburg

This repo contains well-documented scripts to execute different stages of fMRI analysis using SPM. They are written in a way to enable you to write your own code based on them. In order to use them you will have to change a few lines in "utils/get_base_dir.m" and then you should be good to go. That is, if you're a participant of the course and have access to the data. If not, they should still be informative. 
The order to go through is obviously preprocessing -> firstlevel -> secondlevel.

Have fun!
